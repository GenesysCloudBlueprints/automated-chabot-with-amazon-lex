:::

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has created opportunities to improve the customer experience in the contact center space. Machine learning (ML) technologies continually improve and power the contact center customer experience by providing solutions for capabilities like self-service bots, live call analytics, and post-call analytics. Self-service bots integrated with your call center can help you achieve decreased wait times, intelligent routing, decreased time to resolution through self-service functions or data collection, and improved net promoter scores (NPS). Some examples include a customer calling to check on the status of an order and receiving an update from a bot, or a customer needing to submit a renewal for a license and the chatbot collecting the necessary information, which it hands over to an agent for processing.

With [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) bots, you can use [conversational AI](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) capabilities to enable these capabilities within your call center. Amazon Lex uses automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU) to understand the customer’s needs and assist them on their journey.

Genesys Cloud provides a contact center platform in a public cloud model that enables quick and simple integration of [AWS Contact Center Intelligence](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/ml-use-cases/contact-center-intelligence/) (AWS CCI) to transform the modern contact center from a cost center into a profit center. As part of AWS CCI, Genesys Cloud integrates with Amazon Lex, which enables self-service, intelligent routing, and data collection capabilities.

When exploring AWS CCI capabilities with Amazon Lex and Genesys Cloud, you may be unsure of where to start on your bot design journey. To assist those who may be starting with a blank canvas, Amazon Lex provides the [Amazon Lex automated chatbot designer](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/chatbot-designer/). The automated chatbot designer uses ML to provide an initial bot design that you can then refine and launch conversational experiences faster based on your current call transcripts. With the automated chatbot designer, Amazon Lex customers and partners have a straightforward and intuitive way of designing chatbots and can reduce bot design time from weeks to hours. However, the automated chatbot designer requires transcripts to be in a certain format that is not aligned to Genesys Cloud transcript exports.

This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint shows how you can implement an architecture using [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/), [Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Amazon S3), and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) to automatically collect, transform, and load your Genesys call transcripts in the required format for the Amazon Lex automated chatbot designer. You can then run the automated chatbot designer on your transcripts, be given recommendations for bot design, and streamline your bot design journey. You deploy all the components used in this solution with the Terraform Genesys Cloud CX as Code provider AWS provider.

## Scenario

The solution workflow consists of the following steps:

1. Genesys Cloud sends iterative transcripts events to your EventBridge event bus.

2. Lambda receives the iterative transcripts from EventBridge, determines when a conversation is complete, and invokes the Transcript API within Genesys Cloud and drops the full transcript in an S3 bucket.

3. When a new full transcript is uploaded to Amazon S3, Lambda converts the Genesys Cloud formatted transcript into the required format for the Amazon Lex automated chatbot designer and copies it to an S3 bucket.

4. The Amazon Lex automated chatbot designer uses ML to build an initial bot design based on the provided Genesys Cloud transcripts.

## Solution components

* **Genesys Cloud** - A suite of Genesys cloud services for enterprise-grade communications, collaboration, and contact center management. Contact center agents use the Genesys Cloud user interface.

* [Configure Genesys Cloud and Amazon using Terraform](#configure-genesys-cloud-and-amazon-using-terraform)
* [Configure Genesys Cloud and Amazon manually](#configure-genesys-cloud-and-amazon-manually)

### Download the repository that contains the project files

1. Clone the [automated-chabot-with-amazon-lex repository](https://github.com/GenesysCloudBlueprints/automated-chabot-with-amazon-lex "Opens the automated-chabot-with-amazon-lex repository in GitHub").
2. Clone the [lex-automated-chatbot-designer-genesys-transcripts repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/lex-automated-chatbot-designer-genesys-transcripts "Opens the lex-automated-chatbot-designer-genesys-transcripts repository in GitHub")

## Configure Genesys Cloud and Amazon using Terraform

### Set up Genesys Cloud

1. To run this project using the Terraform provider, open a Terminal window and set the following environment variables:

 * `GENESYSCLOUD_OAUTHCLIENT_ID` - This variable is the Genesys Cloud client credential grant Id that CX as Code executes against. 
 * `GENESYSCLOUD_OAUTHCLIENT_SECRET` - This variable is the Genesys Cloud client credential secret that CX as Code executes against. 
 * `GENESYSCLOUD_REGION` - This variable is the Genesys Cloud region in your organization.

2. Run Terraform in the folder where you set the environment variables. 

### Configure your Terraform build

Set the following values in the **/terraform/dev.auto.tfvars** file that are specific to your Genesys Cloud organization:

* `aws_account_id` - The AWS Account ID associated with the event source creation.
* `aws_region` - The AWS region where the event source is made available for an event bus. For example, `us-east-1`.
* `aws_event_bus_name` - A unique name appended to the event source in the AWS account. The name can be up to 64 characters and includes lower or uppercase letters, numbers, and the special characters '.', '-', and '_'.
* `genesys_cloud_organization_id` - Your Genesys Cloud organization ID. In Genesys Cloud, you can navigate from **Admin** > **Organization Settings** > **Advanced** to get the ID.

The following is an example of the **dev.auto.tfvars** file.

```
aws_account_id                = "aws-account-id"
aws_region                    = "aws-region"
aws_event_bus_name            = "gc-event-streaming"
genesys_cloud_organization_id = "genesys-cloud-org-id"
```

### Run Terraform

You are now ready to run this blueprint solution for your organization.

1. Change to the **/terraform** folder.
2. Issue the following commands:

* `terraform init` - This command initializes a working directory that contains the Terraform configuration files.

* `terraform plan` - This command executes a trial run against your Genesys Cloud organization and shows you a list of all the Genesys Cloud resources it creates. Review this list and make sure that you are comfortable with the plan before you continue to the second step.

* `terraform apply --auto-approve` - This command creates and deploys the necessary objects in your Genesys Cloud account. The `--auto-approve` flag completes the required approval step before the command creates the objects.

After the `terraform apply --auto-approve` command successfully completes, you see the output of the entire run along with the number of objects that Terraform successfully created. Keep the following points in mind:

* This project assumes that you run this blueprint solution with a local Terraform backing state, which means that the `tfstate` files are created in the same folder where you run the project. Terraform recommends that you use local Terraform backing state files only if you run from a desktop and are comfortable with the deleted files.

* As long as you keep your local Terraform backing state projects, you can tear down this blueprint solution. To tear down the solution, change to the `docs/terraform` folder and issue the `terraform destroy --auto-approve` command. This command destroys all objects that the local Terraform backing state currently manages.

### Role and OAuth configuration

1. Navigate to **Admin > People & Permissions > Roles / Permissions > People**.
2. Assign the `Transcription Role` to your user account.
3. Navigate to **Admin > Integrations > OAuth > `Transcription OAuth Client`**.
4. In the **Roles** tab, enable the `Transcription Role` toggle.

You can now jump to [Deploy the solution](#deploy-the-solution) section.

## Configure Genesys Cloud and Amazon manually

### Deploy the Genesys EventBridge integration

To enable the EventBridge integration with Genesys Cloud, complete the following steps:

1. Log in to the Genesys Cloud environment.
2. In **Admin** > **Integrations** > **Add Integrations** > **Amazon EventBridge Source**.
3. On the Configuration tab, provide the following information:
   * For **AWS Account ID**, enter your AWS account ID.
   * For **AWS Account Region**, enter the Region where you want EventBridge to be set up.
   * For **Event Source Suffix**, enter a suffix (for example, genesys-eb-poc-demo).
4. Save your configuration.
  ![EventBridge integration configuration](./images/eventbridge-integration.png)
5. On the EventBridge console, choose **Integration** in the navigation pane, then choose **Partner event sources**. There should be an event source listed with a name like `aws.partner/genesys.com/…/genesys-eb-poc-demo`.
  ![Partner event source](./images/partner-event-source.png)
6. Select the partner event source and choose **Associate with event bus**. The status changes from **Pending** to **Active**. This sets up the EventBridge configuration for Genesys.
  ![Associated partner event source](./images/partner-event-source-associated.png)

### Set up Genesys Cloud OAuth credentials

1. In **Admin** > **Integrations** > **OAuth**, choose **Add Client**.
2. On the **Client Details** tab, provide the following information:
  * For **App Name**, enter a name (for example, `TranscriptInvoke-creds`).
  * For **Grant Types**, select **Client Credentials**.
  Make sure you’re using the right role that has access to invoke the Transcribe APIs.
3. Click **Save**.

This generates new values for **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Copy these values to use in the next section, where you configure the template for the solution.
![OAuth Client Credentials](./images/oauth-client-creds.png)

## Deploy the solution

After you have set up the Genesys EventBridge integration, you can deploy an [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) (AWS SAM) template, which deploys the remainder of the architecture. To deploy the solution in your account, complete the following steps:
1. Install AWS SAM if not installed already. For instructions, refer to [Installing the AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html).
2. Download the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/lex-automated-chatbot-designer-genesys-transcripts) and unzip to your directory.
3. Navigate to the `lex-automated-chatbot-designer-genesys-transcripts` folder and run the following commands:
  ```
  sam build --use-container
  sam deploy --guided
  ```
The first command will build the source of your application. The second command will package and deploy your application to AWS, with a series of prompts:

 * **Stack Name**: The name of the stack to deploy to [AWS CloudFormation](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation). This should be unique to your account and region, and a good starting point would be something matching your project name.
 * **AWS Region**: The AWS region you want to deploy your app to. Make sure it is deployed in the same region as the Event bridge
 * **Parameter GenesysBusname**: This is the bus name created when Genesys integration is configured. As mentioned in the prerequisites section enter the name of the bus here. The pattern of the bus name should look like `aws.partner/genesys.com/*`
 * **Parameter ClientId**: This is mentioned in the prerequisite section, copy the parameter value from Genesys Cloud CX.
 * **Parameter ClientSecret**: This is mentioned in the prerequisite section, copy the parameter value from Genesys Cloud CX.
 * **Parameter FileNamePrefix**: This is the file name prefix for the target transcript file in the raw bucket. There is a default value associated with it, but can be changed.
 * **Parameter GenCloudEnv**: This is the cloud environment for the specific Genesys organization. Genesys is available in more than 15 regions world wide today, so this value is mandatory and should point to the environment where your organization is created in Genesys eg: usw2.pure.cloud
 * **Confirm changes before deploy**: If set to yes, any change sets will be shown to you before execution for manual review. If set to no, the AWS SAM CLI will automatically deploy application changes. 
 * **Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation**: Many AWS SAM templates, including this example, create [AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) roles required for the AWS Lambda function(s) included to access AWS services. By default, these are scoped down to minimum required permissions. To deploy an AWS CloudFormation stack which creates or modifies IAM roles, the `CAPABILITY_IAM` value for `capabilities` must be provided. If permission isn't provided through this prompt, to deploy this example you must explicitly pass `--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM` to the `sam deploy` command.
 * **Save arguments to samconfig.toml**: If set to yes, your choices will be saved to a configuration file inside the project, so that in the future you can just re-run `sam deploy` without parameters to deploy changes to your application.

 After you deploy your AWS SAM application in your account, you can test that Genesys transcripts are being sent to your account and being transformed into the required format for the Amazon Lex automated chatbot designer.

## Test the solution

After you have set up the Genesys EventBridge integration and deployed the preceding AWS SAM template, you can make test calls and validate that files are ending up in the S3 bucket for transformed files. At a high level, you need to perform the following steps:
1. Make a test call to your Genesys instance to create a transcript.
2. Wait a few minutes and check the TransformedTranscript bucket for the output.

### Run the automated chatbot designer

After you have a few days’ worth of transcripts saved in Amazon S3, you can run the automated chatbot designer through the Amazon Lex console using the steps in this section. For more information about the minimum and maximum amount of turns for the service, refer to [Prepare transcripts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/designing-import.html#import-prepare).

1. On the Amazon Lex V2 console, choose **Bots in the navigation pane**. Click **Create bot**.
  ![Create bot](./images/create-bot.png)
2. Select **Start with transcripts** as the creation method. Give the bot a name (for this example, `InsuranceBot`) and provide an optional description.
3. Select **Create a role with basic Amazon Lex permissions** and use this as your runtime role.
  ![IAM Role](./images/iam-role.png)
4. After you fill out the other fields, choose **Next** to proceed to the language configuration.
5. Choose the language and voice for your interaction.
  ![Add language to bot](./images/add-language-to-bot.png)
6. Specify the Amazon S3 location of the transcripts that the solution has converted for you.
7. Add additional local paths if you have a specific a folder structure within your S3 bucket.
  ![Add additional language](./images/add-additional-language.png)
8. Apply a filter (date range) for your input transcripts.
  ![Apply filter](./images/apply-filter.png)
9. Choose **Done**.

You can use the status bar on the Amazon S3 console to track the analysis. Within a few hours, the automated chatbot designer surfaces a chatbot design that includes user intents, sample phrases associated with those intents, and a list of all the information required to fulfill them. The amount of time it takes to complete training depends on several factors, including the volume of transcripts and the complexity of the conversations. Typically, 600 lines of transcript are analyzed every minute.

1. Choose **Review** to view the intents and slot types discovered by the automated chatbot designer. The **Intents** tab lists all the intents along with sample phrases and slots, and the **Slot types** tab provides a list of all the slot types along with slot type values.
  ![View intent](./images/view-intent.png)
  ![Intents and Slot types](./images/intents-and-slot-types.png)
  
2. Choose any of the intents to review the sample utterances and slots. For example, in the following screenshot, we choose `ChangePassword` to view the utterances.
  ![Sample utterance](./images/sample-utterance.png)
3. Choose the **Associated transcripts tab** to review the conversations used to identify the intents.
  ![Associated transcripts](./images/associated-transcripts.png)
4. After you review the results, select the intents and slot types relevant to your use case and choose **Add**. This adds the selected intents and slot types to the bot. You can now iterate on this design by making changes such as adding prompts, merging intents or slot types, and renaming slots.
  ![Add intents and slot types](./images/add-intents-and-slot-types.png)

You have now used the Amazon Lex automated chatbot designer to identify common intents, utterances mapped to those intents, and information that the chatbot needs to collect to fulfill certain business functions.

### Clean up

When you’re finished, clean up your resources by using the following command within the AWS SAM CLI:

```
sam delete
```
